Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements, the Khel Ratna Award, India\\'s highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, two of India\\'s highest civilian awards.[10][11] A few hours after the end of his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister\\'s Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India\\'s highest civilian award.[12][13] As of 2021, he is the youngest recipient to date and was the first sportsperson to receive the award.[14][15] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[16] In 2010, Time magazine included Tendulkar in its annual Time 100 list as one of the most influential people in the world.[17] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 ICC Awards.[18]',\n",
